"""Legacy shim: constants moved to ``aeb.core.constants``.

Deprecated path â€“ please migrate to::

	from aeb.core.constants import SafetyConstants

This shim now avoids ``import *`` to satisfy linters while still re-exporting
the public API defined in ``aeb.core.constants.__all__``.

Scheduled for removal in 0.4.0; migrate soon.
